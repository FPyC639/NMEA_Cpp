# NMEA Cpp

In this latest venture I used a GPS Sensor and NMEA Sentences, along with COM Port Connection on my laptop to collect GPS sentences. The Programming Lanaguage of Choice was C++. I found it to be very insightful as I used a lot of prompt engineering to debug and trouble shoot the code. I hope to learn more from the language and what it has to offer in the world of hardware.
