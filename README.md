# NMEA Cpp

In this latest venture I used a GPS Sensor and NMEA Sentences, along with COM Port Connection on my laptop to collect GPS sentences. The Programming Lanaguage of Choice was C++. I found it to be very insightful as I used a lot of prompt engineering to debug and trouble shoot the code. I hope to learn more from the language and what it has to offer in the world of hardware.

# Update December 6, 2024
In this latest version I added a minute detail of having the ability to inject a timestamp into the data collection of the GPS data. The application is working in C++
I hope to have in the future a C# version of the application that also performs the same functionality.

# Update December 10, 2024
In this latest version I managed adjust the insertion of the time stamps from chunks of data being collected to, now each line having a timestamp of the data being collected.
